# Ethical Moderation Lab

[Ethical Moderation](https://dylanirlbeck.github.io/ethical-moderation/project) is a programming project that forces students to grapple with the ethics of content moderation. The project was built for students, by students, and it is designed to be open-source: we want to be part of a larger wave of revamped ethics education in computer science.

This repository contains the coding portion of the project. Students will use Python and Jupyter Notebook to construct a working content moderation algorithm and contemplate its efficacy.

## Setup

First, clone the repo (or download and unzip):

```
git clone https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/ethical-moderation-lab.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd ethical-moderation-lab
```

Install required packages:

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Running

This project relies on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) for running the code. After ensuring you have it downloaded, run

```
jupyter notebook
```

and open the `code.ipynb` file. The rest of the lab is completed inside the notebook. (If you haven't used Jupyter Notebook before, you can read a [quick-start tutorial](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) or its [official documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#).)
